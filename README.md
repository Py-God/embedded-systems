# Embedded Systems Learning Journey

This repository documents my step-by-step learning in **Embedded Systems**.  
It contains theory notes, simulations, code, and reflections from each lesson.  

The goal is to keep track of what I learn, practice, and build — while also creating a resource I (and others) can revisit later.

- Each **lesson has its own folder** under `entries/`.  
- A lesson folder may contain:
  - `notes.md` → Documentation notes for that lesson.  
  - Images (`.png`, `.jpg`, etc.).  
  - Simulation files (e.g., Proteus `.pdsprj`).  
  - Code files if required.
